# Data Retention & Lifecycle Management

This document details the data retention, archival, and purge processes within the Talenttrust-Backend repository. The retention engine ensures that our data lifecycle adheres to compliance standards, maintains tamper-evident audit trails, and executes operations safely.

## 1. The Data Lifecycle Model

The lifecycle of a record strictly follows three primary states: **Active → Archived → Purged**.

### Active State
When data is created, the `RetentionPolicyEngine` (`src/retention/policies.ts`) assigns an expiration date. 
Retention policies are mapped to periods (durations in milliseconds):
- **30 Days**: `30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`
- **90 Days** (Default fallback): `90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`
- **180 Days** (6 Months): `180 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`
- **365 Days** (1 Year): `365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`
- **730 Days** (2 Years): `730 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`
- **Indefinite**: `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`

### Archival Selection
The system checks if a record has reached its expiration date (`now >= expiresAt`). 
If expired, the `DataArchivalService` (`src/retention/archival.ts`) takes over:
- It generates an archival path format: `/archive/{storageType}/{entityType}/{year}/{month}/{dataId}`
- It determines if encryption is required. Data classified as `RESTRICTED` or `CONFIDENTIAL` is unconditionally encrypted, overriding any lax policy configurations.
- The record is marked as `isArchived: true`, tagged with an `archivedAt` timestamp, and passed to the appropriate storage backend.

### Purge / Deletion Window Enforcement
The purge engine (`src/retention/purge.ts`) evaluates whether archived records have exceeded their post-archival retention window (defaulting to 30 days after `archivedAt`). 
Expired local active records (without policies) or expired cold storage archives are permanently purged using the `StorageManager` API. The purge script tracks processed IDs in a `seenArchiveIds` set to prevent double-counting or double-deleting records that share identical storage providers (e.g., `COLD_STORAGE` and `ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE`).

## 2. Storage Backends & Compliance Audit Proofs

### Storage Backends
Our storage abstraction layer (`src/retention/storage.ts`) delegates data to different destinations via the `StorageManager`:
- **Storage Types**: `LOCAL`, `CLOUD`, `COLD_STORAGE`, and `ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE`.
- **Implementations**:
  - `SqliteStorageProvider`: The primary persistent provider. It uses table names like `retention_local` or `retention_archive`. It features SQLite-backed storage that ensures atomicity, survivability across restarts, and paginated reading (capped at `1000` records to avoid memory bloat).
  - `InMemoryStorageProvider`: Used primarily for isolation during testing and development.

### Compliance Audit Proofs
To guarantee non-repudiation and regulatory accountability, the `ComplianceAuditLogger` (`src/retention/audit.ts`) records all state changes:
- For destructive actions—specifically `DELETE` and `ARCHIVE`—the system constructs a JSON payload containing the entity type, action, actor, timestamp, and details.
- This payload is signed via SHA-256 HMAC utilizing the environment secret `COMPLIANCE_AUDIT_SECRET`.
- The resulting signature serves as a verifiable, tamper-evident cryptographic proof (`proof`) bound to the `ComplianceAuditLog`, allowing independent verification via `verifyProof(log)`.

## 3. Configuration & Safety Guarantees

### Environment Variables & Settings
- `COMPLIANCE_AUDIT_SECRET`: Required string used as the HMAC secret key for generating audit log proofs.
- `RETENTION_DRY_RUN`: If set to `true` (or run with the flag `--dry-run`), the purge process strictly calculates and outputs candidate counts per table without executing any `DELETE` operations.

### Safety & Idempotency
- **Idempotent Storage**: The SQLite provider utilizes an `INSERT OR REPLACE` strategy. Repeatedly storing a record with the same ID correctly overwrites it rather than throwing uniqueness constraints or creating duplicates. This allows for safe partial re-runs.
- **Dry-Run Integrity**: The dry-run purge mode shares the *exact same* logic and database queries as the destructive execution branch. This guarantees that simulated outputs accurately reflect what will actually be deleted.
- **Redaction**: Purge and audit logs sanitize raw PII objects before logging out. Data payloads are stripped, replaced with `[REDACTED]`, and emails are masked.
- **Transaction Safety**: Bounded queries (`limit: 1000` per page) and SQLite statement reuse prevents resource exhaustion and out-of-memory errors when processing large backlogs of expired records.

## 4. Workflow Sequence Diagram

The following Mermaid diagram outlines the progression from an active state to eventual deletion, emphasizing the compliance audit tracking checkpoint.

### Relationship with Event Idempotency TTL
The `DataRetentionManager` operates independently from the **Event Idempotency TTL** mechanism (`src/events/idempotency.ts`). While the Data Retention module enforces long-term storage and compliance logic (e.g. archiving old contracts after years), the idempotency store employs short-lived TTLs (e.g. 24 hours) for deduplication tracking.
- The Idempotency TTL only governs the lifespan of duplicate event detection and its corresponding metrics (`event_idempotency_evictions_total`). 
- **No Conflict**: The idempotency key eviction logic does not race against or conflict with the `purge.ts` engine, as idempotency entries are maintained in their own discrete store/table distinct from the local active data and cold storage archives.

## Usage Examples

    Active->>Policy: Check Expiration (now >= expiresAt)
    Policy-->>Archival: Trigger Archive (if expired)
    
    rect rgb(240, 248, 255)
        Note over Archival, ArchiveStore: Archival Selection & Storage
        Archival->>Archival: Evaluate Encryption (Classification)
        Archival->>ArchiveStore: store(archivedData)
    end
    
    Archival->>Audit: logAction(ARCHIVE)
    Audit->>Audit: Generate SHA-256 HMAC Proof
    
    Note over ArchiveStore, Purge: Post-Archival Window
    Purge->>ArchiveStore: Query (archivedAt + postArchivalDays <= now)
    
    rect rgb(255, 240, 245)
        Note over Purge, Audit: Deletion Enforcement
        Purge->>ArchiveStore: Delete Record
        Purge->>Audit: logAction(DELETE)
        Audit->>Audit: Generate SHA-256 HMAC Proof
    end

## Data Retention & Compliance

This repository enforces automated data lifecycle management—archiving and purging records based on strict retention policies. All destructive actions generate a tamper-evident HMAC compliance proof.
